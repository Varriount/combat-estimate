4. Profit! That's really it! The dialog should load very quickly and display a rough estimate of how much damage each creature will do on each attack if it hits, as well as how likely they are to hit against enemy armor classes/saving throws (still a work in progress).

1. Calculating saving throws
1. Applying resistances
1. Legendary actions
1. Lair actions
1. Player class features: Great weapon master, sharpshooter, sneak attack, etc.
